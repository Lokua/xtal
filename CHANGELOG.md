# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is loosely based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The project will
eventually adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
when it reaches v1, but until then consider all changes as possibly breaking.

## [0.16.0] 2025-10-22

### Fixed

- Lazy copy/paste in global resulted in all ports using `midi_clock_port`
  instead of respective in and out ports

## [0.15.0] 2025-05-02

### Added

- Keyboard shortcut `[?]` or `[/]` to toggle help view
- Labels to Separator controls
- `Animation::ramp_plus`; same as `ramp` with range mappings and phase offset,
  also available in control scripts via `type: ramp`.
- `Easing::Curve` for symmetric exponential easing (-1.0 ease out, 0.0 linear,
  1.0 ease in), also available in a control script context via the Math effect
  set to `operator: curve`

### Changed

- Added custom `useKeyDownOnce` hook since native keydown continuously fires
  when held, keypress is deprecated, and keyup isn't great for timing sensitive
  actions.
- Similar to above handling of keydown on the backend via held-key tracking
- Renamed `Animation::loop_phase` to `Animation::ramp`

### Fixed

- Xtal no longer assumes the user's system will have MIDI or audio ports or that
  any saved port configurations will be valid on next launch; now uses fallback
  port if available or None when no ports exist

## [0.14.0] 2025-04-26

## Added

- Support for any number of textures (or however many a single bind group layout
  can support)

## Changed

- Removed `watch` argument from higher-level `GpuState` constructors

## [0.13.0] 2025-04-23

### Fixed

- Fixed regression in ui_controls caused by moving to shared to trait which
  returned cloned configs for the configs call instead of config references
  which results in disabled_fn always being None; added new config_refs fn for
  this one case.

## [0.12.1] 2025-04-??

- crates.io debug deployments

## [0.12.0] 2025-04-18

### Changed

- Renamed the project from Lattice to Xtal (maybe you get it)

### Added

- Ability to serve frontend via static assets and wry custom protocol

## [0.11.0] 2025-04-17

### Changed

- Separated the single binary application containing xtal and my sketches into a
  proper xtal lib and sketches app. This is step 1 for making xtal a reusable
  library – still a lot more to do

## [2025-04-14]

### Added

- `Context::should_clear` to give a sketches a way to perform reset routines
  when the **Clear** button is pressed.
- `Context::background` helper that enables the classic "trails" effect while
  also extracting the base color with fill opacity to use as the clear color
  when pressing **Clear** button.

### Changed

- Marked `SketchDerived::clear_color` as deprecated in favor of the new
  background helper.

### Fixed

- RingModula – didn't properly support param modulation for its `mix` parameter
- `DepGraph` no longer stores consumers that aren't themselves prerequisite
  nodes. This led to misplaced calls to `Hub::get` and warnings for consumers
  that are also effects (since effect values aren't calculated in `get`)

## [0.10.0] 2025-04-13

### Added

- A small info icon to the top right of the console that will toggle between
  showing help and system alerts as having them both show depending on timing
  could be disjointed (when hovering over a help-ready element, alerts were not
  seen until mouse-out)

### Changed

- Toggling fullscreen from GUI or Main window now uses F instead of requiring a
  modifier since we aren't using F for anything else
- Improved the appearance of disabled controls

### Fixed

- Converting string values from the backend now uses the control's kind for
  branching instead of deriving from what the control's value looks like since
  Selects can have values that appear to be numeric

## [0.9.0] 2025-04-12

### Added

- Control labels will now subtly flash in and out (in sync with the BPM!) while
  their control is in transition to indicate progress
- **Data**, **Images**, and **Videos** directory options in settings to give the
  user control. These will be the conventional directories on the host OS if
  possible, otherwise will default to `$HOME/[Images|Videos|Documents]/Xtal`
- Add **Open cache dir** and **Open config dir** buttons to settings

### Changed

- Now using the OS cache dir for video frames instead of the config dir
- Now using the OS config dir instead of this repo's ./storage folder for
  GlobalSettings.
- `image_index.json` has been changed to `image_metadata.json` and is now stored
  in the user's chosen **Data** dir.
- Removed the need for need for sketches to have to manually call
  `ControlHub::update`

### Fixed

- ToggleGuiFocus (F) and ToggleMainFocus (M) now work as expected

### Settings

![UI Settings](assets/ui-settings-0.9.0.png)

## [0.8.0] - 2025-04-11

### Added

- `ControlHub::select` which makes choosing between a manual slider or animation
  for a single destination slightly less noisy

### Changed

- **Snapshots** UI now appears as a header on top of the controls area instead
  of covering it so we can see the final "snap" of values after the transition.
  I'm still not 100% happy with the design but it's good enough for now and a
  definite improvement over the previous iteration.
- Keyboard shortcuts: **Capture Image** is now `I` instead of `S`; `S` now
  toggles the **Snapshots** panel.
- Removed frontend alerts. From now on the concept of "alert" pertains only to
  messages from the backend.
- Prevent allowing a user map the same MIDI channel/cc pair to multiple
  destinations which wasn't and likely never will be supported since you can
  just a single slider for as many things as you want in code

### Fixed

- MIDI mapping a slider that only functioned as a modulation source did not
  result in the destination parameter being modulated because the proxy was not
  known as a dependency. See
  [Issue #22](https://github.com/Lokua/xtal/issues/22)
- Renaming a control in a Hub would cause orphaned proxies. See
  [Issue #23](https://github.com/Lokua/xtal/issues/23)

## [0.7.0] - 2025-04-10

### Added

- Zoom! Re-added the **Settings > Appearance** section and a new **Font Size**
  option that will scale most UI elements from default to large and largest for
  a11y's sake (unfortunately webviews or at least Apple's does not support +/-
  zoom like most browsers do)
- In addition to already being able to click a control's label to randomize it,
  you can now `<PlatformModifier> + Click` to revert it back to its last saved
  value.
- Exclusions column can now be toggled via `E` key

### Changed

- Converted all sizing units in CSS to rem/em to support the new "zoom" feature
- NumberBox in Controls now properly blurs when pressing Enter and supports
  `<PlatformModifier> + A` to select all text
- Keyboard shortcuts are not platform aware, using `meta` aka `logo` on Mac and
  `ctrl` on Linux/Windows (untested)
- Singe Parameter Randomization is no longer connected to the sketch-level
  Exclusions - in other words you can still click to randomize a single
  parameter even if it's in the exclusions list.
- Remove dark-light library in favor of Tao's automatic theme awareness which is
  pretty damn awesome

### Fixed

- Previously added a **Disable Mappings** feature but forgot to add the
  corresponding logic in Controls.tsx to actually enable slider control when
  needed - works as expected now
- Mo' Proxies Mo' Problems. Similar to the issue in [0.4.0](#040---2025-04-07),
  we were prematurely unwrapping the result of a `UiControls::slider_range` call
  for a slider that didn't exist (again, for a leftover MIDI proxy as the result
  of renaming/debugging). TODO: cleanup data before loading/saving to disk to
  avoid this entirely
- Converting backend string value representations to numbers on the frontend now
  uses `Number` and an `isFinite` check to work around limitations in
  `parseFloat` which cannot parse numbers that have higher precision than f32
  can hold, which resulted in some sliders having an `undefined` value.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-04-08

### Added

- UI for Snapshots
- **Disable Mappings** and **Delete Mappings** buttons to the MIDI Mapping
  panel. Disabled state is saved along with Global Settings.

### Changed

- Removed `docs/parameter_handling.md` due to being outdated and not very
  helpful

### Fixed

- Crash when switching to a sketch with a WGPU Depth Texture and window size
  that differed from the previous sketch. We were correctly updating the winit
  window in the app and texture size in `GpuState`, but Nannou's frame seems to
  be a single frame behind window updates (presumably because it doesn't get
  updated until the next update cycle as opposed to "this" update cycle) which
  led to the depth texture size mismatch with the Nannou frame. When this is the
  case we log a warning and exit the `GpuState::render` early for that frame.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-04-07

### Added

- Reload button next to Sketch selector that reloads the current sketch
  instantly

## [0.4.0] - 2025-04-07

### Added

- Ability to exclude any specific UI control from Randomization + persistence of
  exclusions along with a sketch's program state
- Tiny icons next to a control's label to indicate if it is excluded or MIDI
  mapped
- Strike-through on labels that are bypassed in a Control Script
- Ability to randomize a _single_ control by clicking its label. Hovering over a
  randomizable control (those that aren't bypassed or disabled) will show a
  highlighted background and prepend `<-?` characters to hopefully make it
  obvious what this does?

### Changed

- Removed the **Include Checkboxes** and **Include Selects** options from
  settings since the new Exclusions feature offers more flexibility
- Completely overhauled the `web_view::Control` structure to avoid the
  awkwardness of untagged enums due to
  [bincode](https://github.com/bincode-org/bincode). The frontend control code
  is much, much cleaner now.

### Fixed

- Bug where loading a sketch that has saved program state with MIDI proxies and
  no corresponding Slider range would cause a panic. This could only happen when
  a user saved state, then changed the slider name in their source code, then
  tried to reload the program. `UiControls::slider_range` now returns an option
  instead of panicking and `SaveableProgramState::setup_midi_mappings` will now
  bypass those invalid mappings and log an error to the console with remediation
  steps.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-04-06

### Added

- Documentation for the `disabled` micro-DSL in
  [Control Script Reference](docs/control_script_reference.md)
- Help text for all UI elements
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as our font

### Changed

- `ControlHub` now ensures that bypassed values are returned before transition
  values. This is especially crucial for sketches where a slider when at its max
  value might slaughter performance and you'd like to avoid hitting that max via
  the Randomization feature; now you can easily bypass controls to exclude them
  from Randomization. The side effect here is that `bypassed` will now override
  any snapshot values...need to think through this, but it's the lesser problem
  and perhaps not a problem at all.
- Custom `Checkbox.tsx` implementation using checked icon instead of font
  character to avoid off-by-1 pixel aliasing or whatever it's called
- Split console into Alert and Help views. When hovering over elements, the Help
  view will display help information for that element. This provides more
  immediate access to help information than native titles provide.
- Removed the `useIcons` setting and text-only buttons in favor of help-view and
  titles so we don't sacrifice a11y due to icon-only buttons

### Fixed

- `overflow: hidden` to UI body to prevent that silly bounce effect

## [0.2.0] - 2025-04-05

### Added

- New **Randomize** feature via button `[?]` or `Cmd+R` that utilizes a
  temporary snapshot to linearly interpolate from the current state of all
  controls to a randomized state with respect to a control's given min, max, and
  step.
- Settings options for Randomization to in/exclude checkboxes and selects
- New **Appearance** section in the settings tab with a **Use icons** toggle to
  switch between icon buttons and text buttons. Will likely do away with this
  options once we settle on which is a better user experience.

### Changed

- The order of operations in `ControlHub::get` has changed to support the
  Randomize feature; previously we 1. looked up alias then 2. checked
  transition; now we 1. look up alias then 2. look up MIDI proxy name and _then_
  check the transition. This may have unintended side effects and I do not
  remember why we didn't support proxies in transitions to begin with.
- Send MIDI out for all CCs when a snapshot, random or otherwise, ends
- Send MIDI out for all CCs when a sketch is switched - no more having to
  manually click `Send`
- Refactored `param_mod` effect trait implementations to use a declarative macro
  to reduce a significant amount of boilerplate

### Fixes

- `transition_time` is now properly retained when switching sketches

## [0.1.0] - 2025-04-05

Just now adding a changelog. For changes between November of 2024 and now you
must consult the commit history, but overall at this point we have:

- Built an entire framework around Nannou
- Moved from EGUI for UI to using React/Typescript in a WebView rendered with
  Tao and Wry which has provided amazing UI flexibility at the cost of added
  complexity
- Per sketch MIDI, OSC, UI, and Audio Controls via the ControlHub struct with
  disk persistence
- A live "scripting" mechanism for all controls and animations with
  hot-reloading via ControlHub featuring parameter modulation (use sliders or
  animations to control the parameters of other animations and effects - crazy)
- A comprehensive musical-timing based animation suite featuring DAW-style
  automation breakpoints with complex curves like ramps, random, random smooth,
  and various synth-style waveforms that can amplitude modulated
- Shader support with various templates to get up and running quickly
- A somewhat advanced yet undocumented `uniforms` proc-macro to ease the
  boilerplate of creating wgsl vec4 uniform "banks" and having to manually
  initialize them and pass them to the shader
- Ability to MIDI map controllers to sliders in the UI aka "MIDI learn"
- Capture up to 10 snapshots of all parameters on a per-sketch basis; snapshots
  are linearly interpolated from/to at an adjustable beat-based duration
- Global persistence of MIDI, OSC, and audio ports selectable in the UI's
  Settings View.
- Ability to randomize all sketch parameters via Cmd+R (POC - need to integrate
  this with the snapshot system)

## [0.0.0] - 2024-11-30
